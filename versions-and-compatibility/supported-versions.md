# ðŸ”± Supported Versions

Nitrocid KS has a wide assortment of versions developed within its entire lifetime, with 0.0.1 being the very first version released on February 22, 2018. However, we can't keep supporting all the versions of the project at the same time, so we've made a table of supported version series.

## List of supported version series

This list shows how long the version series and their accompanying versions under the series are supported, with security support periods for long-term releases, which usually start with each major or minor API revision update.

_All dates are in MM/DD/YYYY._
